## 3.1 Elementary matrix operations and elementary matrices

### Definition

Let $$ A $$ be an $$ m \times n $$ matrix.
Any one of following three operations on the rows [columns] of $$ A $$ is called an elementary row [column] operation:  
(1) Type 1: interchanging any two rows [columns] of $$ A $$  
(2) Type 2: multiplying any row [column] of $$ A $$ by a nonzero scalar  
(3) Type 3: adding any scalar multiple of a row [column] of $$ A $$ to another row [column].

### Definition

An $$ n \times n $$ elementary matrix is a matrix obtained by performing an elementary operation on $$ I_n $$.
The elementary matrix is said to be of type 1, 2, or 3 according to whether the elementary operation performed on $$ I_n $$ is a type 1, 2, or 3 operation, respectively.

### Theorem 3.1

Let $$ A \in \mathsf{M}_{m \times n}(F) $$, and suppose that $$ B $$ is obtained from $$ A $$ by performing an elementary row [column] operation.
Then there exists an $$ m \times m $$ $$[n \times n] $$ elementary matrix $$ E $$ such that $$ B = EA $$ $$ [B = AE] $$.
In fact, $$ E $$ is obtained from $$ I_m $$ $$ [I_n] $$ by performing the same elementary row [column] operation as that which was performed on $$ A $$ to obtain $$ B $$.
Conversely, if $$ E $$ is an elementary $$ m \times m $$ $$ [n \times n] $$ matrix, then $$ EA $$ $$ [AE] $$ is the matrix obtained from $$ A $$ by performing the same elementary row [column] operation as that which produces $$ E $$ from $$ I_m $$ $$ [I_n] $$.

### Theorem 3.2

Elementary matrices are invertible, and the inverse of an elementary matrix is an elementary matrix of the same type.

**Proof**  
Let $$ E $$ be an elementary $$ n \times n $$ matrix.
Then $$ E $$ can be obtained by an elementary row operation on $$ I_n $$.
By reversing the steps used to transform $$ I_n $$ into $$ E $$, we can transform $$ E $$ back into $$ I_n $$.
The result is that $$ I_n $$ can be obtained from $$ E $$ by an elementary row operation of the same type.
By Theorem 3.1, there is an elementary matrix $$ \overline{E} $$ such that $$ \overline{E} E = I_n $$.
Therefore, $$ E $$ is invertible and $$ E^{-1} = \overline{E} $$. $$ \blacksquare $$

## 3.2 The rank of a matrix and matrix inverses

### Definition

If $$ A \in \mathsf{M}_{m \times n}(F) $$, we define the rank of $$ A $$, denoted rank($$ A $$), to be the rank of the linear transformaion $$ \mathsf{L}_A : \mathsf{F}^n \rightarrow \mathsf{F}^m $$.

### Theorem 3.3

Let $$ \mathsf{T} : \mathsf{V} \rightarrow \mathsf{W} $$ be a linear transformation between finite-dimensional vector spaces, and let $$ \beta $$ and $$ \gamma $$ be ordered bases for $$ \mathsf{V} $$ and $$ \mathsf{W} $$, respectively.
Then rank($$ \mathsf{T} $$) $$ = $$ rank($$ {[\mathsf{T}]}_{\beta}^{\gamma} $$).

### Theorem 3.4

Let $$ A $$ be an $$ m \times n $$ matrix.
If $$ P $$ and $$ Q $$ are invertible $$ m \times m $$ and $$ n \times n $$ matrices, respectively, then  
(a) rank($$ AQ $$) $$ = $$ rank($$ A $$)  
(b) rank($$ PA $$) $$ = $$ rank($$ A $$)  
(c) rank($$ PAQ $$) $$ = $$ rank($$ A $$)

**Proof**  
First observe that

$$
\begin{align*}
    \mathsf{R}({\mathsf{L}}_{AQ}) = \mathsf{R}({\mathsf{L}}_A {\mathsf{L}}_Q) = {\mathsf{L}}_A {\mathsf{L}}_Q ({\mathsf{F}}^n) = {\mathsf{L}}_A ({\mathsf{L}}_Q({\mathsf{F}}^n)) = {\mathsf{L}}_A ({\mathsf{F}}^n) = \mathsf{R}({\mathsf{L}}_A)
\end{align*}
$$

since $$ {\mathsf{L}}_Q $$ is onto.
Therefore

$$
\begin{align*}
    \text{rank}(AQ) = \dim(\mathsf{R}({\mathsf{L}}_{AQ})) = \dim(\mathsf{R}({\mathsf{L}}_A)) = \text{rank}(A)
\end{align*}
$$

This establishes (a).
Establishing (b) is left for an exercise.
Finally, applying (a) and (b), we have

$$
\begin{align*}
    \text{rank}(PAQ) = \text{rank}(PA) = \text{rank}(A)
\end{align*}
$$

### Corollary

Elementary row and column operations on a matrix are rank-preserving.

**Proof**  
If $$ B $$ is obtained from a matrix $$ A $$ by an elementary row operation, then there exists an elementary matrix $$ E $$ such that $$ B = EA $$.
By Theorem 3.2, $$ E $$ is invertible, and hence rank($$ B $$) $$ = $$ rank($$ A $$) by Theorem 3.4.
The proof that elementary column operations are rank-preserving is left as an exercise. $$ \blacksquare $$

### Theorem 3.5

The rank of any matrix equals the maximum number of its linearly independent columns; that is, the rank of a matrix is the dimension of the subspace generated by its columns.

**Proof**  
For any $$ A \in {\mathsf{M}}_{m \times n}(F) $$,

$$
\begin{align*}
    \text{rank}(A) = \text{rank}({\mathsf{L}}_A) = \dim(\mathsf{R}({\mathsf{L}}_A))
\end{align*}
$$

Let $$ \beta $$ be the standard ordered basis for $$ \mathsf{F}^n $$.
Then $$ \beta $$ spans $$ \mathsf{F}^n $$ and hence, by Theorem 2.2,

$$
\begin{align*}
    \mathsf{R}({\mathsf{L}}_A) = \text{span}({\mathsf{L}}_A(\beta)) = \text{span}(\{ {\mathsf{L}}_A(e_1), \ {\mathsf{L}}_A(e_2), \dots, {\mathsf{L}}_A(e_n) \})
\end{align*}
$$

But, for any $$ j $$, we have seen in Theorem 2.13(b) that $$ {\mathsf{L}}_A(e_j) = Ae_j = a_j $$, where $$ a_j $$ is the $$ j $$th column of $$ A $$.
Hence

$$
\begin{align*}
    \mathsf{R}({\mathsf{L}}_A) = \text{span}(\{ a_1, \ a_2, \dots, a_n \})
\end{align*}
$$

Thus

$$
\begin{align*}
    \text{rank}(A) = \dim(\mathsf{R}({\mathsf{L}}_A)) = \dim(\text{span}(\{ a_1, \ a_2, \dots, a_n \}))
\end{align*}
$$

### Theorem 3.6

Let $$ A $$ be an $$ m \times n $$ matrix of rank $$ r $$.
Then $$ r \le m $$, $$ r \le n $$, and, by means of a finite number of elementary row and column operations, $$ A $$ can be transformed into the matrix

$$
\begin{align*}
    D = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
        I_r & O_1 \\
        O_2 & O_3
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

where $$ O_1 $$, $$ O_2 $$, and $$ O_3 $$ are zero matrices.
Thus $$ D_{ii} = 1 $$ for $$ i \le r $$ and $$ D_{ij} = 0 $$ otherwise.

**Proof**  
If $$ A $$ is the zero matrix, $$ r = 0 $$.
In this case, the conclusion follows with $$ D = A $$.
Now suppose that $$ A \neq O $$ and $$ r = $$ rank($$ A $$); then $$ r > 0 $$.
The proof is by mathematical induction on $$ m $$, the number of rows of $$ A $$.  
Suppose that $$ m = 1 $$.
By means of at most one type 1 column operation and at most one type 2 column operation, $$ A $$ can be transformed into a matrix with a $$ 1 $$ in the $$ 1, \ 1 $$ position.
By means of at most $$ n - 1 $$ type 3 column operations, this matrix can in turn be transformed into the matrix

$$
\begin{align*}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 0 & \cdots & 0
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

Note that there is one linearly independent column in $$ D $$.
So rank($$ D $$) $$ = $$ rank($$ A $$) $$ = 1 $$ by the corollary to Theorem 3.4 and by Theorem 3.5.
Thus the theorem is established for $$ m = 1 $$.  
Next assume that the theorem holds for any matrix with at most $$ m - 1 $$ rows (for some $$ m > 1 $$).
Suppose that $$ A $$ is any $$ m \times n $$ matrix.
If $$ n = 1 $$, Theorem 3.6 can be established in a manner analogous to that for $$ m = 1 $$.
We now suppose that $$ n > 1 $$.
Since $$ A \neq O $$, $$ A_{ij} \neq 0 $$ for some $$ i $$, $$ j $$.
By means of at most one elementary row and at most one elementary column operation (each of type 1), we can move the nonzero entry to the $$ 1, \ 1 $$ position.
By means of at most one additional type 2 operation, we can assure a $$ 1 $$ in the $$ 1, \ 1 $$ position.
By means of at most $$ m - 1 $$ type 3 row operations and at most $$ n - 1 $$ type 3 column operations, we can eliminate all nonzero entries in the first row and the first column with the exception of the $$ 1 $$ in the $$ 1, \ 1 $$ position.  
Thus, with a finite number of elementary operations, $$ A $$ can be transformed into a matrix

$$
\begin{align*}
    B =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \begin{array}{c|ccc}
            1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
            \hline
            0 & & & \\
            \vdots & & B' & \\
            0 & & &
        \end{array}
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$
