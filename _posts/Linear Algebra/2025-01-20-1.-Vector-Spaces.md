## 1.1 Vector spaces

### Definitions

A vector space (or linear space) $$ \mathsf{V} $$ over a field F consists of a set on which two operations (addition and scalar multiplication) are defined so that for each pair of elements $$ x $$, $$ y $$, in $$ \mathsf{V} $$ there is a unique element $$ x + y $$ in $$ \mathsf{V} $$, and for each element $$ a $$ in $$ F $$ and each element $$ x $$ in $$ \mathsf{V} $$ there is a unique element $$ ax $$ in $$ \mathsf{V} $$, such that the following conditions hold.

- (VS 1) For all $$ x $$, $$ y $$ in $$ \mathsf{V} $$, $$ x + y = y + x $$ (commutativity of addition).
- (VS 2) For all $$ x $$, $$ y $$, $$ z $$ in $$ \mathsf{V} $$, $$ (x + y) + z = x + (y + z) $$ (associativity of addition).
- (VS 3) There exists an element in $$ \mathsf{V} $$ denoted by $$ 0 $$ such that $$ x + 0 = x $$ for each $$ x $$ in $$ \mathsf{V} $$.
- (VS 4) For each element $$ x $$ in $$ \mathsf{V} $$ there exists an element $$ y $$ in $$ \mathsf{V} $$ such that $$ x + y = 0 $$.
- (VS 5) For each element $$ x $$ in $$ \mathsf{V} $$, $$ 1x = x $$.
- (VS 6) For each pair of elements $$ a $$, $$ b $$ in $$ F $$ and each element $$ x $$ in $$ \mathsf{V} $$, $$ (ab)x = a(bx) $$.
- (VS 7) For each element $$ a $$ in $$ F $$ and each pair of elements $$ x $$, $$ y $$ in $$ \mathsf{V} $$, $$ a(x + y) = ax + ay $$.
- (VS 8) For each pair of elements $$ a $$, $$ b $$ in $$ F $$ and each element $$ x $$ in $$ \mathsf{V} $$, $$ (a + b)x = ax + bx $$.

### Theorem 1.1 (Cancellation Law for Vector Addition)

If $$ x $$, $$ y $$, and $$ z $$ are vectors in a vector space $$ \mathsf{V} $$ such that $$ x + z = y + z $$, then $$ x = y $$.

**Proof**  
There exists a vector $$ v $$ in $$ \mathsf{V} $$ such that $$ z + v = 0 $$ (VS 4).
Thus

$$
\begin{align*}
    x &= x + 0 = x + (z + v) = (x + z) + v \\
      &= (y + z) + v = y + (z + v) = y + 0 = y
\end{align*}
$$

by (VS 2) and (VS 3). $$ \blacksquare $$

### Corollary 1.

The vector $$ 0 $$ described in (VS 3) is unique.

### Corollary 2.

The vector $$ y $$ described in (VS 4) is unique.

### Theorem 1.2

In any vector space $$ \mathsf{V} $$, the following statements are true:  
(a) $$ 0x = 0 $$ for each $$ x \in \mathsf{V} $$.  
(b) $$ (-a)x = -(ax) = a(-x) $$ for each $$ a \in F $$ and each $$ x \in \mathsf{V} $$.  
(c) $$ a0 = 0 $$ for each $$ a \in F $$.

**Proof**  
(a) By (VS 8), (VS 3), and (VS 1), it follows that

$$
\begin{align*}
    0x + 0x = (0 + 0)x = 0x = 0x + 0 = 0 + 0x
\end{align*}
$$

Hence $$ 0x = 0 $$ by Theorem 1.1.  
(b) The vector $$ -(ax) $$ is the unique element of $$ \mathsf{V} $$ such that $$ ax + [-(ax)] = 0 $$.
Thus if $$ ax + (-a)x = 0 $$, Corollary 2 to Theorem 1.1 implies that $$ (-a)x = -(ax) $$.
But by (VS 8),

$$
\begin{align*}
    ax + (-a)x = [a + (-a)]x = 0x = 0
\end{align*}
$$

by (a).
Consequently $$ (-a)x = -(ax) $$.  
The proof of (c) is similar to the proof of (a). $$ \blacksquare $$

## 1.2 Subspaces

### Definitions

A subset $$ \mathsf{W} $$ of a vector space $$ \mathsf{V} $$ over a field $$ F $$ is called a subspace of $$ \mathsf{V} $$ if $$ \mathsf{W} $$ is a vector space over $$ F $$ with the operations of addition and scalar multiplication defined on $$ \mathsf{V} $$.

A subset $$ \mathsf{W} $$ of a vector space $$ \mathsf{V} $$ is a subspace of $$ \mathsf{V} $$ if and only if the following four properties hold.

1. $$ x + y \in \mathsf{W} $$ whenever $$ x \in \mathsf{W} $$ and $$ y \in \mathsf{W} $$. ($$ \mathsf{W} $$ is closed under addition.)
2. $$ cx \in \mathsf{W} $$ whenever $$ c \in F $$ and $$ x \in \mathsf{W} $$. ($$ \mathsf{W} $$ is closed under scalar multiplication.)
3. $$ \mathsf{W} $$ has a zero vector.
4. Each vector in $$ \mathsf{W} $$ has an additive inverse in $$ \mathsf{W} $$.

### Theorem 1.3

Let $$ \mathsf{V} $$ be a vector space and $$ \mathsf{W} $$ a subset of $$ \mathsf{V} $$.
Then $$ \mathsf{W} $$ is a subspace of $$ \mathsf{V} $$ if and only if the following three conditions hold for the operations defined in $$ \mathsf{V} $$.  
(a) $$ 0 \in \mathsf{W} $$.  
(b) $$ x + y \in \mathsf{W} $$ whenever $$ x \in \mathsf{W} $$ and $$ y \in \mathsf{W} $$.  
(c) $$ cx \in \mathsf{W} $$ whenever $$ c \in F $$ and $$ x \in \mathsf{W} $$.

**Proof**  
If $$ \mathsf{W} $$ is a subspace of $$ \mathsf{V} $$, then $$ \mathsf{W} $$ is a vector space with the operations of addition and scalar multiplication defined on $$ \mathsf{V} $$.
Hence conditions (b) and (c) hold, and there exists a vector $$ 0' \in \mathsf{W} $$ such that $$ x + 0' = x $$ for each $$ x \in \mathsf{W} $$.
But also $$ x + 0 = x $$, and thus $$ 0' = 0 $$ by Theorem 1.1.
So condition (a) holds.  
Conversely, if conditions (a), (b), and (c) hold, the discussion preceding this theorem shows that $$ \mathsf{W} $$ is a subspace of $$ \mathsf{V} $$ if the additive inverse of each vector in $$ \mathsf{W} $$ lies in $$ \mathsf{W} $$.
But if $$ x \in \mathsf{w} $$, then $$ (-1)x \in \mathsf{W} $$ by condition (c), and $$ -x = (-1)x $$ by Theorem 1.2.
Hence $$ \mathsf{W} $$ is a subspace of $$ \mathsf{V} $$. $$ \blacksquare $$

### Theorem 1.4

Any intersection of subspaces of a vector space $$ \mathsf{V} $$ is a subspace of $$ \mathsf{V} $$.

**Proof**  
Let $$ \mathcal{C} $$ be a collection of subspaces of $$ \mathsf{V} $$, and let $$ \mathsf{W} $$ denote the intersection of the subspaces in $$ \mathcal{C} $$.
Since every subspace contains the zero vector, $$ 0 \in \mathsf{W} $$.
Let $$ a \in F $$ and $$ x, \ y \in \mathsf{W} $$.
Then $$ x $$ and $$ y $$ are contained in each subspace in $$ \mathcal{C} $$.
Because each subspace in $$ \mathcal{C} $$ is closed under addition and scalar multiplication, it follows that $$ x + y $$ and and $$ ax $$ are contained in each subspace in $$ \mathcal{C} $$.
Hence $$ x + y $$ and $$ ax $$ are also contained in $$ \mathsf{W} $$, so that $$ \mathsf{W} $$ is a subspace of $$ \mathsf{V} $$ by Theorem 1.3. $$ \blacksquare $$
