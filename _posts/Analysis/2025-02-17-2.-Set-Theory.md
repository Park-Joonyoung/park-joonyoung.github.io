## 3.1 Fundamentals

### Definition 3.1.1 (informal)

We define a set $$ A $$ to be any unordered collection of objects.
If $$ x $$ is an object, we say that $$ x $$ is an element of $$ A $$ or $$ x \in A $$ if $$ x $$ lies in the collection; otherwise we say that $$ x \notin A $$.

### Axiom 3.1

If $$ A $$ is a set, then $$ A $$ is also an object.

### Axiom 3.2 (Equity of sets)

Two sets $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ are equal, $$ A = B $$, iff every element of $$ A $$ is an element of $$ B $$ and vice versa.
To put it another way, $$ A = B $$ if and only if every element $$ x $$ of $$ A $$ belongs also to $$ B $$, and every element $$ y $$ of $$ B $$ belongs also to $$ A $$.

### Axiom 3.3 (Empty set)

There exists a set $$ \emptyset $$, known as the empty set, which contains no elements, i.e., for every object $$ x $$ we have $$ x \notin \emptyset $$.

### Lemma 3.1.2 (Single choice)

Let $$ A $$
