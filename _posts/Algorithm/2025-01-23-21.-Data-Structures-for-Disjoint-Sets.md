## 21.1 Disjoint-set operations

A disjoint-set data structure maintains a collection $$ \mathcal{S} = \{ S_1, \ S_2, \dots, S_k \} $$ of disjoint dynamic sets.
We identify each set by a representative, which is some member of the set.
Each element of a set is represented by an object.
Letting $$ x $$ denote an object, we wish to support the following operations:
- MAKE-SET($$ x $$) creates a new set whose only member (and thus representative) is $$ x $$.
Since the sets are disjoint, we require that $$ x $$ not already be in some other set.
- UNION($$ x, \ y $$) unites the dynamic sets that contain $$ x $$ and $$ y $$, say $$ S_x $$ and $$ S_y $$, into a new set that is the union of these two sets.
- FIND-SET($$ x $$) returns a pointer to the representative of the unique set containing $$ x $$.
