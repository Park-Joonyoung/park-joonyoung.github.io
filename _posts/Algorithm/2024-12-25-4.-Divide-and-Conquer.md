In the divide-and-conquer paradigm, we typically solve a problem recursively, applying three steps at each level of the recursion:

1. Divide the problem into a number of subproblems that are smaller instances of the same problem.
2. Conquer the subproblems by solving them recursively, unless the subproblem sizes are small enough.
3. Combine the solutions to the subproblems into the solution for the original problem.

### Recurrences

A recurrence is an equation or inequality that describes a function in terms of its value on smaller inputs.
This chapter offers three methods for solving recurrences:

- Substitution method: we guess a bound and then use mathematical induction to prove our guess correct.
- Recursion-tree method: it converts the recurrence into a tree whose nodes represent the costs incurred at various levels of the recursion.
- Master method: it provides bounds for recurrences of the form

$$
\begin{align*}
    T(n) = a T(n/b) + f(n)
\end{align*}
\label{eq:1}
\tag{4.1}
$$

<p class="indented-paragraph">
where $$ a \ge 1 $$, $$ b > 1 $$, and $$ f(n) $$ is a given function.
A recurrence of the form in equation \eqref{eq:1} characterizes a divide-and-conquer algorithm that creates $$ a $$ subproblems, each of which is $$ 1/b $$ the size of the original problem, and in which the divide and combine steps together take $$ f(n) $$ time.
