Let $$ G = (V, \ E) $$ a connected and undirected graph, and for each edge $$ (u, \ v) \in E $$, we have a weight $$ w(u, \ v) $$ specifying the cost to connect $$ u $$ and $$ v $$.
We wish to find an acyclic subset $$ T \subseteq E $$ that connects all of the vertices and whose total weight

$$
\begin{align*}
    w(T) = \sum_{(u, \ v) \in T} w(u, \ v)
\end{align*}
$$

is minimized.
Since $$ T $$ is acyclic and connects all of the vertices, it must form a tree, which we call a spanning tree.
We call the problem of determining the tree $$ T $$ the minimum-spanning-tree problem.

## 23.1 Growing a minimum spanning tree

Assume that we have a connected, undirected graph $$ G = (V, \ E) $$ with a weight function $$ w : E \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $$, and we wish to find a minimum spanning tree for $$ G $$.
The two algorithms we consider in this chapter use a greedy approach to the problem.
This greedy strategy is captured by the following generic method, which grows the minimum spanning tree one edge at a time.
The generic method manages a set of edges $$ A $$, maintaining the following loop invariant:

> Prior to each iteration, $$ A $$ is a subset of some minimum spanning tree.

>GENERIC-MST($$ G, \ w $$)  
>01&nbsp; $$ A = \emptyset $$  
>02&nbsp; while $$ A $$ does not form a spanning tree  
>03&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;find an edge $$ (u, \ v) $$ that is safe for $$ A $$  
>04&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$$ A = A \cup \{ (u, \ v) \} $$  
>05&nbsp; return $$ A $$

We use the loop invariant as follows:
- Initialization: After line 1, the set $$ A $$ satisfies the loop invariant.
- Maintenance: The loop in lines 2–4 maintains the invariant by adding only safe edges.
- Termination: All edges added to $$ A $$ are in a minimum spanning tree, and so the set $$ A $$ returned in line 5 must be a minimum spanning tree.

A cut $$ (S, \ V - S) $$ of an undirected graph $$ G = (V, \ E) $$ is a partition of $$ V $$.
We say that an edge $$ (u, \ v) \in E $$ crosses the cut $$ (S, \ V - S) $$ if one of its endpoints is in $$ S $$ and the other is in $$ V - S $$.
We say that a cut respects a set $$ A $$ of edges if no edge in $$ A $$ crosses the cut.
An edge is a light edge crossing a cut if its weight is the minimum of any edge crossing the cut.

### Theorem 23.1

Let $$ G = (V, \ E) $$ be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight function $$ w $$ defined on $$ E $$.
Let $$ A $$ be a subset of $$ E $$ that is included in some minimum spanning tree for $$ G $$, let $$ (S, \ V - S) $$ be any cut of $$ G $$ that respects $$ A $$, and let $$ (u, \ v) $$ be a light edge crossing $$ (S, \ V - S) $$.
Then, edge $$ (u, \ v) $$ is safe for $$ A $$.

**Proof**  
Let $$ T $$ be a minimum spanning tree that includes $$ A $$, and assume that $$ T $$ does not contain the light edge $$ (u, \ v) $$.
The edge $$ (u, \ v) $$ forms a cycle with the edges on the simple path $$ p $$ from $$ u $$ to $$ v $$ in $$ T $$.
Since $$ u $$ and $$ v $$ are on opposite sides of the cut $$ (S, \ V - S) $$, at least one edge in $$ T $$ lies on the simple path $$ p $$ and also crosses the cut.
Let $$ (x, \ y) $$ be any such edge.
The edge $$ (x, \ y) $$ is not in $$ A $$, because the cut respects $$ A $$.
Since $$ (x, \ y) $$ is on the unique simple path from $$ u $$ to $$ v $$ in $$ T $$, removing $$ (x, \ y) $$ breaks $$ T $$ into two components.
Adding $$ (u, \ v) $$ reconnects them to form a new spanning tree $$ T' = T - \{ (x, \ y) \} \cup \{ (u, \ v) \} $$.  
We next show that $$ T' $$ is a minimum spanning tree.
Since $$ (u, \ v) $$ is a light edge crossing $$ (S, \ V - S) $$ and $$ (x, \ y) $$ also crosses this cut, $$ w(u, \ v) \le w(x, \ y) $$.
Therefore,

$$
\begin{align*}
    w(T') &= w(T) - w(x, \ y) + w(u, \ v) \\
          &\le w(T)
\end{align*}
$$

But $$ T $$ is a minimum spanning tree, so that $$ w(T) \le w(T') $$; thus $$ T' $$ must be a minimum spanning tree also.  
We have $$ A \subseteq T' $$, since $$ A \subseteq T $$ and $$ (x, \ y) \notin A $$; thus, $$ A \cup \{ (u, \ v) \} \subseteq T' $$.
Consequently, since $$ T' $$ is a minimum spanning tree, $$ (u, \ v) $$ is safe for $$ A $$. $$ \blacksquare $$

The while loop in lines 2–4 of GENERIC-MST executes $$ |V| - 1 $$ times because it finds one of the $$ |V| - 1 $$ edges of a minimum spanning tree in each iteration.
Initially, when $$ A = \emptyset $$, there are $$ |V| $$ trees in $$ G_A $$, and each iteration reduces that number by 1.
When the forest contains only a single tree, the method terminates.

### Corollary 23.2

Let $$ G = (V, \ E) $$ be a connected, undirected graph with a real-valued weight function $$ w $$ defined on $$ E $$.
Let $$ A $$ be a subset of $$ E $$ that is included in some minimum spanning tree for $$ G $$, and let $$ C = (V_C, \ E_C) $$ be a connected component (tree) in the forest $$ G_A = (V, \ A) $$.
If $$ (u, \ v) $$ is a light edge connecting $$ C $$ to some other component in $$ G_A $$, then $$ (u, \ v) $$ is safe for $$ A $$.

**Proof**  
The cut $$ (V_C, \ V - V_C) $$ respects $$ A $$, and $$ (u, \ v) $$ is a light edge for this cut.
Therefore, $$ (u, \ v) $$ is safe for $$ A $$. $$ \blacksquare $$

## 23.2 The algorithms of Kruskal and Prim

### Kruskal's algorithm

Kruskal's algorithm finds a safe edge to add to the growing forest by finding, of all the edges that connect any two trees in the forest, an edge $$ (u, \ v) $$ of least weight.
Let $$ C_1 $$ and $$ C_2 $$ denote the two trees that are connected by $$ (u, \ v) $$.
Since $$ (u, \ v) $$ must be a light edge for $$ C_1 $$ to some other tree, Corollary 23.2 implies that $$ (u, \ v) $$ is a safe edge for $$ C_1 $$.  
Kruskal's algorithm uses a disjoint-set data structure to maintain several disjoint sets of elements.
Each set contains the vertices in one tree of the current forest.
The operation FIND-SET($$ u $$) returns a representative element from the set that contains $$ u $$.
Thus, we can determine whether two vertices $$ u $$ and $$ v $$ belong to the same tree by testing whether FIND-SET($$ u $$) equals FIND-SET($$ v $$).
To combine trees, Kruskal's algorithm calls the UNION procedure.

>MST-KRUSKAL($$ G, \ w $$)  
>01&nbsp; $$ A = \emptyset $$  
>02&nbsp; for each vertex $$ v \in G.V $$  
>03&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAKE-SET($$ v $$)  
>04&nbsp; sort the edges of $$ G.E $$ into nondecreasing order by weight $$ w $$  
>05&nbsp; for each edge $$ (u, \ v) \in G.E $$, taken in nondecreasing order by weight  
>06&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if FIND-SET($$ u $$) $$ \neq $$ FIND-SET($$ v $$)  
>07&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$$ A = A \cup \{ (u, \ v) \} $$  
>08&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UNION($$ u, \ v $$)  
>09&nbsp; return $$ A $$

Lines 1–3 initialize the set $$ A $$ to the empty set and create $$ |V| $$ trees, one containing each vertex.
The for loop in lines 5–8 examines edges in order of weight, from lowest to highest.
The loop checks, for each edge $$ (u, \ v) $$, whether the endpoints $$ u $$ and $$ v $$ belong to the same tree.
If they do, then the edge $$ (u, \ v) $$ cannot be added to the forest without creating a cycle, and the edge is discarded.
Otherwise, the two vertices belong to different trees.
In this case, line 7 adds the edge $$ (u, \ v) $$ to $$ A $$, and line 8 merges the vertices in the two trees.

We assume that we use the disjoint-set-forest implementation of Section 21.3 with the union-by-rank and path-compression heuristics.
Initializing the set $$ A $$ in line 1 takes $$ O(1) $$ time, and the time to sort the edges in line 4 is $$ O(E \lg E) $$.
The for loop of lines 5–8 performs $$ O(E) $$ FIND-SET and UNION operations on the disjoint-set forest.
Along with the $$ |V| $$ MAKE-SET operations, these take a total of $$ O((V + E) \alpha(V)) $$ time, where $$ \alpha $$ is the very slowly growing function defined in Section 21.4.
Because we assume that $$ G $$ is connected, we have $$ |E| \ge |V| - 1 $$, and so the disjoint-set operations take $$ O(E \alpha(V)) $$ time.
Moreover, since $$ \alpha(|V|) = O(\lg V) = O(\lg E) $$, the total running time of Kruskal's algorithm is $$ O(E \lg E) $$.
Observing that $$ |E| < |V|^2 $$, we have $$ \lg |E| = O(\lg V) $$, and so we can restate the running time of Kruskal's algorithm as $$ O(E \lg V) $$.

### Prim's algorithm

Prim's algorithm operates much like Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shortest paths in a graph.
Prim's algorithm has the property that the edges in the set $$ A $$ always form a single tree.
The tree starts from an arbitrary root vertex $$ r $$ and grows until the tree spans all the vertices in $$ V $$.
Each step adds to the tree $$ A $$ a light edge that connects $$ A $$ to an isolated vertex.
By Corollary 23.2, this rule adds only edges that are safe for $$ A $$; therefore, when the algorithm terminates, the edges in $$ A $$ form a minimum spanning tree.
